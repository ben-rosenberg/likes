# Button Clicker/Likes Project

I suspect that the current implementation of the JavaScript features in this assignment is far from optimal, but I was unable to find a significantly better solution given the knowledge I currently have.

Note: I intentionally set the number of initial likes for the first feed item incorrectly strictly for the purpose of demonstrating the program's ability to dynamically change the word "likes" to the singular form when the number of likes is 1.
